## Introduction
This project focuses on creating an exchange rate calculator using React in conjunction with the Fetch API to perform asynchronous requests and manipulate API responses.

## Deployment Link
A deployed version of this project may be found [here.](http://gentle-passenger.surge.sh/)

## Additional Notes
This project uses React's native state handling for all operations. Promises and the Fetch API are used extenisvely in the `AppContainer.js` file to help hydrate the front-end view.
